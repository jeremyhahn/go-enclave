### Added

- `backends/tpm`: `FuzzParseBlob`, a native Go fuzz target that holds the sealed-blob parser to its contract on arbitrary input, with no TPM: it never panics or writes the blob, a refusal matches `ErrSealedAuthentication`, and an accepted blob is exactly the framing of its sealed-object public area and bounded private area (#336).
